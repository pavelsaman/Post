=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<post> application retrieves information from official Czech Post XML feed
L<http://napostu.ceskaposta.cz/vystupy/balikovny.xml> and presents them in
loosely structures text output.

Post app provides a bunch of command-line options for searching desired
branches. They could be combined in any way, but there's always a logical
AND between different commands (e.g. --name and --type) and a logical
OR between same commands (e.g. --name and --name).
So in order to search for all branches in Prague and Brno cities,
you can issue the following command: $ post --name Praha --name Brno
If you, however, want to search for only branches in Prague and Brno that
are of type "posta", you would do that with the following command:
$ post --name Praha --name Brno --type posta

For more information about the command-line options, run the app with --usage
or --help options.

=head1 EXAMPLES

To see branches only in Prague that are open on Saturday between 10:00 and
12:00:

    $ post --city Praha --openduring Day=Saturday StartTime=10:00 EndTime=12:00

To see branches closed on Sunday at 1p.m.:

    $ post -ct Day=Sunday Time=13:00

To see branches closed tomorrow at 1p.m.:

    $ post -ct Day=Tomorrow Time=13:00

You can use one of the following 3 aliases: Yesterday, Today, Tomorow.

To see all depo branches in Ostrava:

    $ post -t depo -c Ostrava
